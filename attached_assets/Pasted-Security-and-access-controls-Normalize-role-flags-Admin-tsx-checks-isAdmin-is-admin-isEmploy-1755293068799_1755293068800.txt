Security and access controls

    Normalize role flags: Admin.tsx checks isAdmin, is_admin, isEmployee, is_employee. Add a server-normalized shape (e.g., roles: ['admin','employee']) and expose a single canonical property on the client to avoid drift.
    Enforce server-side RBAC on every admin endpoint: Some UI pages already redirect non-admins (AdminDashboard.tsx, AdminStaffManagement.tsx), but the real gate must be on the server. Keep requireAdmin on routes like backup, users, orders, etc., and avoid any “staff” access unless explicitly needed.
    Remove header hacks: Admin.tsx sometimes sets x-admin-token for “compatibility.” Standardize on Authorization with your unified token and route all admin calls through a single API client.
    Audit log and sensitive actions: Surface GET /api/admin/recent-activity in the UI and require typed confirmation for destructive operations (delete user, backup/restore, bulk updates). Log who did what, when.

UX and navigation

    Make /admin the dashboard hub, split management into clear sections:
        Users: /admin/users (current Admin.tsx)
        Orders: /admin/orders
        Products and categories: /admin/products, /admin/categories
        Tax: /admin/tax (flat taxes, audits, preview)
        Loyalty: /admin/loyalty (manual adjust, stats)
        Content and exports: /admin/exports (inventory, customers)
        Backups: /admin/backups (list, create, download, delete, restore)
        Account onboarding: /admin/account-requests (approve/reject)
        System health and insights: /admin/system-health, /admin/business-insights
    Use a consistent Admin layout with a left sidebar, breadcrumbs, and tabs. You already have BreadcrumbNavigation; apply it across all admin pages.
    Mobile experience: Admin.tsx has mobile-specific branches; ensure actions, drawers/modals, and tables degrade gracefully on small screens.

User management (Admin.tsx)

    Filters, search, sort, pagination: Filter by role, customer level, company; sort by recent activity; add server-side pagination and virtualized rows for performance.
    Inline details drawer: Clicking a user opens a side panel with summary, addresses (GET /api/admin/customers/:customerId/addresses), order history (GET /api/admin/users/:userId/orders), notification/consent status, and quick actions.
    Bulk actions: Select-and-apply for role changes, notification preferences, or password reset prompts (with audit trail).
    Validation and feedback: Ensure every mutation returns helpful errors, shows toasts, and optimistically updates lists (then revalidates).

Products, categories, and orders

    Products:
        Toggle visibility (PUT /api/admin/products/:id/visibility)
        Price history and sales analytics views (GET /api/admin/products/:id/price-history, /sales-analytics)
        Archived products screen with unarchive actions
        Bulk update/import flows with progress and failure reporting
    Categories:
        Drafts and visibility screens
        Merge categories UI (POST /api/admin/categories/merge)
    Orders:
        Admin order list with search, status updates, and a full detail view
        Purchase orders workflow (list, receive, status changes)

Compliance and communications

    Tax center: Manage flat taxes, preview calculations, and view audits in one place.
    Consent center: Show SMS/email marketing consent (GET/PUT /api/admin/sms-consent…), with per-user overrides.
    AI recommendations: Status, regenerate, and history endpoints exist—add a simple controls panel.

Backups and system admin

    Backups page: List backups (GET /api/admin/backup), create, download, delete, and restore—with big warnings, environment labels, and role restrictions. Run restores behind a feature flag and require typed confirmation.
    System health and insights: Surface /api/admin/system-health and /api/admin/business-insights on the dashboard with minimal cards and links to drill downs.

Code health improvements for the admin area

    Single API client: Replace scattered fetch usage with your apiRequest helper to ensure Authorization is always attached, handle 401s consistently, and centralize error handling.
    Remove legacy/debug endpoints from UI: Avoid wiring anything like simple cart endpoints into production admin. Keep dev-only routes behind an env flag.
    Componentize forms and tables: Extract reusable AdminTable, AdminForm, and ConfirmDialog with consistent styles and validation.
