## üõ† Installation & Setup

### 1. Database Setup

First, create the required database tables:

```sql
-- Customer Credit Accounts
CREATE TABLE customer_credit_accounts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  credit_limit DOUBLE PRECISION DEFAULT 0,
  current_balance DOUBLE PRECISION DEFAULT 0,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Credit Transactions
CREATE TABLE credit_transactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  invoice_payment_id INTEGER,
  order_id INTEGER,
  transaction_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  amount DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  processed_by VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Invoice Payments
CREATE TABLE invoice_payments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  order_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  invoice_number VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  amount DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  is_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  payment_method VARCHAR,
  payment_date TIMESTAMP,
  check_number VARCHAR,
  paid_by VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Performance Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_credit_accounts_customer_id ON customer_credit_accounts(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_credit_transactions_customer_id ON credit_transactions(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_payments_customer_id ON invoice_payments(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_payments_is_paid ON invoice_payments(is_paid);
```

### 2. Backend Integration

Add the storage interface methods to your existing storage layer:

```typescript
// Import the credit management implementation
import { DatabaseCreditStorage, CreditWorkflowManager } from './credit-management-backend';

// Add to your existing storage class
class YourStorageClass extends DatabaseCreditStorage {
  // Your existing methods...
}

// Register API routes
import { registerCreditManagementRoutes } from './credit-management-backend';
registerCreditManagementRoutes(app, storage, requireAuth, requireEmployeeOrAdmin, requireAdmin);
```

### 3. Frontend Integration

Add the React components to your admin interface:

```typescript
// In your admin routing
import AdminCreditManagement from './AdminCreditManagement';

// Add route
<Route path="/admin/credit-management" component={AdminCreditManagement} />
```

### 4. Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
# Backend dependencies
npm install drizzle-orm drizzle-zod zod

# Frontend dependencies  
npm install @tanstack/react-query @radix-ui/react-* lucide-react
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are required. The system uses your existing database connection.

### Authentication

The system requires admin/staff role authentication. Ensure your authentication middleware provides:
- `requireAuth` - Basic authentication
- `requireEmployeeOrAdmin` - Staff/admin access
- `requireAdmin` - Admin-only access

## üí° Usage Examples

### Creating a Credit Account

```typescript
// Automatic creation when first accessed
const creditAccount = await storage.getCustomerCreditAccount(customerId);
// If no account exists, one is created automatically with 0 limit
```

### Processing an On-Account Order

```typescript
// When order is placed with payment method "on_account"
const creditWorkflow = new CreditWorkflowManager(storage);

// Check credit availability
const creditCheck = await creditWorkflow.checkCreditAvailability(customerId, orderTotal);
if (!creditCheck.available) {
  throw new Error('Insufficient credit available');
}

// Process the order
const invoiceNumber = InvoiceNumberGenerator.generate();
await creditWorkflow.processOnAccountOrder(orderId, customerId, orderTotal, invoiceNumber);
```

### Processing a Payment

```typescript
// When customer makes a payment
await creditWorkflow.processPayment(
  customerId, 
  paymentAmount, 
  'check', 
  'staff-user-id', 
  'CHK-12345'
);
```

### Managing Credit Limits

```typescript
// Update customer credit limit
await storage.updateCustomerCreditLimit(customerId, 5000);

// Log the change
await storage.createCreditTransaction({
  customerId,
  transactionType: 'adjustment',
  amount: 0,
  description: 'Credit limit updated to $5000',
  processedBy: adminUserId
});
```
