Here are focused, high‑impact improvements and implementation suggestions across your server and client. I’ve included a few small, drop‑in files (skeletons) to make them immediately actionable.

Top recommendations

    Unify authentication and token handling
        Create a single client auth module that reads/writes one token shape, supports POS tokens explicitly, and centralizes clear/restore logic.
        On the server, keep exactly one POST /api/login and feature‑flag OIDC under /api/oidc/*.
        Prefer only the Authorization: Bearer header; remove x-auth-token.

    Normalize endpoints and methods
        Standardize on RESTful semantics (e.g., DELETE /api/cart/clear, DELETE /api/admin/clear-global-cart), remove GET side‑effect variants, and keep one path/method per action.
        Add consistent pagination, sorting, and filtering contracts for list endpoints.

    Enforce input validation and error shapes
        Use Zod (shared schemas) with a simple validate middleware; return a consistent error envelope (code, message, details).

    Add rate limiting and anti‑abuse
        Protect login, OTP generation, and POS verification endpoints with IP+user keyed rate limits and incremental backoff.

    Harden security defaults
        Apply Helmet; restrict CORS via env allowlist; ensure no GET endpoints perform mutations; remove “emergency”/temp routes from production builds.

    Audit logging and idempotency
        Log admin actions with userId, IP, and resource identifiers.
        Use idempotency keys for write endpoints (orders, bulk updates, POS operations) to avoid duplicate writes during retries/offline sync.

    POS consolidation
        Standardize token key to pos_auth_token and a single session verify path (e.g., POST /api/pos/session/verify).
        Remove duplicate Instore login pages; keep a single flow (OTP + trusted device) and align storage.

    CI guardrails
        Enforce endpoint uniqueness in dev/CI (wrap registration and validate against a registry).
        Generate OpenAPI (or at least a machine‑readable endpoint manifest) and diff in CI.

    Client quality
        Replace console logs in production builds; prefer a logger with levels.
        Remove any and add explicit types for user/roles.
        Extract reusable Admin table/form components and unify staff/admin user management into one page.
