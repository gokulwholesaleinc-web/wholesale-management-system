    Multiple coexisting auth systems and duplicate routes
        Files like server/routes-clean.ts, server/routes-consolidated.ts, server/routes_backup.ts.bak, server/routes.ts.backup and server/routes/auth.ts each define login or full route sets. That increases the chance of route duplication, handler drift, or conflicting middleware. See server/routes-consolidated.ts and server/routes-clean.ts both registering POST /api/login.
        Replit OIDC (server/replitAuth.ts) is also present and throws if REPLIT_DOMAINS isn’t set; it installs express-session with secure cookies and a PG session store. If this runs unintentionally, it can break local/dev.
        Why it matters: Production may end up with the wrong login handler, or dev runs fail due to missing env vars or HTTPS. Fix by choosing one auth approach, deleting backups, and validating endpoints against an explicit registry in CI.

    POS token validation is effectively “accept any format”
        server/routes/posRoutes.ts → /api/pos/validate-session returns valid: true for “any valid POS token format” and does not actually verify state or pos_session.
        Why it matters: Anyone can craft a pos-… token and bypass checks. Implement signed/expiring POS JWTs (with audience=pos), verify them server-side, and bind to a saved session record.

    Inconsistent token names and headers across the app
        Tokens referenced as: authToken, token, gokul_unified_auth, pos_auth_token, posAuthToken, tempAuthToken. Some calls use none.
            Example mismatches:
                PrinterService uses localStorage.getItem('posAuthToken') but the rest of POS uses 'pos_auth_token'.
                PosSystem.tsx creates Authorization from localStorage.getItem('token') (likely undefined).
                Many admin pages fetch without Authorization headers (e.g., AdminAddressManagement.tsx hits /api/admin/delivery-addresses without auth).
        Why it matters: Random 401s, or accidental unauthenticated access in dev. Fix by centralizing getAuthToken in a single helper and migrating all fetches to it.

    OTP and device trust for POS are not durable or rate-limited
        OTP is stored in a process-level Map (server/routes/posRoutes.ts), lost on restart and not shared across processes; rate limiting not visible; expiry enforced only on client UI.
        Why it matters: Clustered deployments or restarts break OTP flows; brute-forcing not throttled. Persist OTPs (short TTL) in DB/Redis, enforce server-side expiry and lockouts, add rate limits per username/device/IP.

    Replit session store requires a sessions table and HTTPS
        server/replitAuth.ts sets createTableIfMissing: false and cookie.secure: true. Local HTTP will drop cookies; missing sessions table will throw; REPLIT_DOMAINS env requirement throws at import-time.
        Why it matters: Hard-to-diagnose 500s in dev or staging. Gate replitAuth behind a feature flag, set secure=false in non-HTTPS, and/or skip session middleware entirely when not using OIDC.

    “Dangerous” DOM patterns and inline HTML
        Several places replace parent.innerHTML on image error handlers (e.g., client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx, ProductDetailModal.tsx, MobileCartModal.tsx). Chart component injects CSS using dangerouslySetInnerHTML (legit for CSS, but blocked by strict CSP).
        Why it matters: With a strict CSP, these patterns can break; if any unescaped user content slips into those templates, it’s an XSS vector. Replace innerHTML snippets with React elements and avoid inline HTML generation.

    Mixed API calling conventions and missing Authorization
        Lots of direct fetch('/api/...') without a shared request helper; some omit Authorization entirely (e.g., AdminAddressManagement.tsx PUT/DELETE); others rely on different token stores.
        Why it matters: Production will have inconsistent auth and caching behavior. Standardize on apiRequest (client/src/lib/queryClient.ts) or a thin wrapper that always attaches headers and handles 401.

    Debug and test code shipped alongside production
        Files like client/src/components/TestLogin.tsx and debug_frontend_auth.html exist and use direct POST /api/login with minimal checks. server/routes.ts.backup includes relaxed endpoints like /api/simple-get-cart/:userId and /api/simple-remove-from-cart.
        Why it matters: Accidental exposure is a security risk. Exclude test/demo files in production builds and prevent mounting any backup/legacy routes.

    Email/SMS service hard-fails on env vars at import
        server/services/accountRequestService.ts throws if SENDGRID_API_KEY is unset. This can take down the server even if login or unrelated paths are being tested.
        Why it matters: Dev/staging workflows frequently lack full credentials; prefer soft-fail (warn + no-op) outside production, or lazy-load/email only when invoked.

    CORS and cookies configuration
        Some route sets add Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*' while many fetches send credentials: include. Browsers block wildcard + credentials.
        Why it matters: Intermittent auth failures across environments. Set an explicit origin allow-list for credentials, or avoid credentials with token headers only.

Other notable issues and gotchas

    Two instore login UIs (InstoreLogin.tsx and InstoreLoginNew.tsx) diverge in flow and tokens used (authToken vs pos tokens). Pick one and unify.
    The endpoint registry server/endpointRegistry.ts looks static and minimal; it won’t actually catch duplicates registered in other files.
    Some POS endpoints trust the user from req.user without explicit middleware in posRoutes; ensure requireAdmin/requireEmployee is consistently used or set req.user via verified POS token.
    Email templates interpolate request data into HTML in accountRequestService.ts without escaping. Emails are less XSS-sensitive, but it’s still best practice to escape or sanitize.
    Backup/restore classes (server/backup.ts, server/simpleBackup.ts) silently skip entire tables and write large JSON files; ensure access control and storage quotas if exposed.
    Biometric auth hooks hit /api/auth/login and /api/auth/biometric-login; corresponding server routes weren’t found in the consolidated route set. Dead endpoints will confuse users; hide the feature or implement the endpoints.
    Query client special-cases POS 401s to only clear POS tokens; but many POS pages use fetch directly and won’t get that behavior.

Recommended changes (actionable)

    Consolidate auth and routes
        Keep server/routes/auth.ts as the single source for POST /api/login and friends. Remove/dead-code eliminate routes-*.ts backups and duplicated login handlers.
        Feature-flag Replit OIDC. Only apply getSession() and passport middleware when explicitly enabled; otherwise skip that code path.

    POS security hardening
        Replace pos token strings with signed JWTs (audience=pos, short TTL).
        Implement /api/pos/validate-session to verify JWT signature, exp, and session record in DB. Tie pos_session to a server-side record keyed by device fingerprint and user ID.
        Persist OTPs with TTL, enforce server-side expiry, add per-username+IP rate limits.

    Unify token storage and usage
        Create a single getAuthToken() helper that checks, in order: gokul_unified_auth.token, pos_auth_token (when inside /instore), and falls back to legacy.
        Replace all direct fetch calls to use a shared api client (or apiRequest) so headers are consistent.

    Clean up UI scripts and innerHTML usage
        Replace innerHTML error fallbacks with React JSX fallback components.
        Ensure CSP allows required inline styles for Chart or refactor to CSS variables without injecting style tags.

    Make emailing optional in non-prod
        Change hard-throw on SENDGRID_API_KEY missing to a soft warning unless NODE_ENV=production. Lazy-load SendGrid on first use.

    Fix cookie/cors for local and prod
        If you keep cookies: set cookie.secure based on env and HTTPS. Otherwise, prefer Authorization: Bearer only and drop cookies entirely for the simple auth paths.
        Replace Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*' when credentials are used; allow-list your front-end origin.

    Remove or guard debug/test components and emergency endpoints
        Ensure TestLogin, debug pages, and “simple” cart endpoints are not shipped. Add a build-time flag or route guard.

    Verify admin pages
        Update AdminAddressManagement and other admin pages to use apiRequest so Authorization and error handling are correct.
