# Critical Password Reset Debug Summary

## Current Status
Password reset emails are being delivered successfully, but the password is not updating in the database.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Email Delivery**: Confirmed working - emails are being sent successfully
2. **SMS Delivery**: Confirmed working - SMS messages are being sent 
3. **Token Validation**: Working - fake tokens correctly return "Invalid or expired link"
4. **SMS CTA Verification**: Implemented and functional

### ❌ Problem Area
**Password Update in Database**: The password reset completion process is not updating the password hash in the database.

## Technical Investigation

### Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to:
- `passwordResetService.ts` - tracks token processing and password update calls
- `storage.ts` - tracks database operations for password updates
- `updateUserPassword()` method - logs password hashing and database update

### Expected Log Flow (when working)
```
[RESET] Starting password reset completion...
[RESET] Valid token found for user: USER_ID
[RESET] Updating password for user: USER_ID
[STORAGE] Updating password for user: USER_ID
[STORAGE] Password hashed successfully
[STORAGE] Password updated in database for user: USERNAME
[RESET] Password updated successfully for user: USERNAME
```

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Get Fresh Token**: Check email for the reset token sent at ~7:59 PM
2. **Test Complete Flow**: Use the token with this command:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://shopgokul.com/api/auth/password-reset/complete" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"token": "TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL", "newPassword": "NewTestPassword123!"}' \
     -w "\nStatus: %{http_code}\n"
   ```
3. **Check Server Logs**: Monitor console logs for the debug output above
4. **Test Login**: Try logging in with the new password

## Potential Root Causes
1. Token hash mismatch in database lookup
2. Password update transaction failure
3. User ID mismatch between token and user record
4. Database permission or connection issue

The debug logging will help identify which of these is the actual issue.
