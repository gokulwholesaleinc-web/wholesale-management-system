# SMS Password Reset Debug Guide

## Current Status: ✅ SMS System Configured & Enhanced Logging Added

### Twilio Configuration Verified:
- ✅ TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: Configured
- ✅ TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: Configured  
- ✅ TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER: Configured

### Enhanced Logging Added:
Now when you trigger a password reset, you'll see detailed logs including:
- User capabilities (email/SMS availability)
- Phone number (partially masked for security)
- Delivery channel selection
- SMS sending status and Twilio message ID

## How to Test SMS Password Reset:

### 1. Request SMS Password Reset
**API Call:**
```bash
POST /api/auth/password-reset
{
  "identifier": "your_phone_or_username",
  "channel": "sms"
}
```

**Or use the frontend with channel selector (if available)**

### 2. Check Server Logs for Debug Information:
Look for these log entries:
```
[RESET] sending URL -> https://shopgokul.com/reset-password?token=...
[RESET] User capabilities: { 
  userId: "123", 
  hasEmail: true/false, 
  hasSms: true/false, 
  phone: "+15***1234",
  requestedChannel: "sms",
  finalChannel: "sms" 
}
[RESET] Sending SMS to: +15***1234
[RESET] SMS sent successfully: { messageId: "SM..." }
```

### 3. Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue: `hasSms: false`**
- User account has no phone number configured
- Check user profile in admin panel for phone number

**Issue: SMS sending fails**
- Check Twilio account balance
- Verify phone number format (needs E.164: +1234567890)
- Check Twilio console for error details

**Issue: `finalChannel: "email"` when requesting SMS**
- User has email but no phone number
- System falls back to email when SMS unavailable

### 4. Phone Number Format Requirements:
- Must be in E.164 format: `+1234567890`
- US numbers: `+1` + area code + number
- Example: `+16305409910`

### 5. Test with Debug Mode:
1. Trigger password reset with `channel: "sms"`
2. Monitor server logs for detailed debugging info
3. Check Twilio console for delivery status
4. Verify phone can receive SMS from Twilio number

## Next Steps:
1. Test the SMS reset functionality 
2. Share the server logs so I can diagnose any issues
3. Verify your phone number format in the user account
4. Check if you can receive SMS from other services

The enhanced logging will help identify exactly where the SMS process might be failing.
