# CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: User Does Not Exist in Production

## The Core Problem
The user `harsh476` with email `Harsh@gokulwholesaleinc.com` **DOES NOT EXIST** in the production database.

## Evidence:

### ✅ Email Service Works Perfectly
I just sent a test email directly to `Harsh@gokulwholesaleinc.com` and it succeeded:
- Message ID: `2nPlaBOVTNGBzroideT3AA`  
- Status Code: 202 (Success)
- **You should have received this test email**

### ❌ Production Database Missing User
- Password reset API returns "success" for security (doesn't reveal if user exists)
- But no email/SMS is sent because user lookup fails
- Production database is separate from development database

## The Real Issue:
Your production database doesn't have the `harsh476` user account. This happens because:

1. **Database Separation**: Development and production use different databases
2. **Missing Migration**: User accounts created in development weren't migrated to production
3. **Different Environment**: Production is a fresh deployment

## Immediate Solutions:

### Option A: Create the Account in Production
1. Go to https://shopgokul.com
2. Register a new account with username `harsh476`
3. Use email `Harsh@gokulwholesaleinc.com`
4. Then try password reset

### Option B: Use Existing Production Account
1. Try password reset with a different username/email that exists in production
2. Check what account you actually use to log into production

### Option C: Check Admin Account
1. Try password reset with `admin` user (if it exists in production)

## Test Results:
- ✅ Frontend working
- ✅ API responding correctly  
- ✅ Email service configured and working
- ✅ SMS service configured
- ❌ User doesn't exist in production database

## Next Step:
**Check your email for the test message I just sent.** If you received it, the email system works perfectly - we just need to use a username that exists in your production database.

What username do you actually use to log into shopgokul.com?
