# SMS CTA Verification System Fixed

## The Issue
When users received password reset links via SMS and clicked them, they weren't getting the required TCPA-compliant opt-out verification message.

## The Fix

### 1. Enhanced SMS Password Reset Links
- Modified SMS reset messages to include `sms=true` parameter in links
- Added "Reply STOP to opt out" to SMS text for immediate compliance visibility

### 2. Automatic SMS Verification Detection
- Reset password page now detects when accessed via SMS link (`?sms=true`)
- Automatically triggers SMS opt-out verification when appropriate

### 3. New SMS Verification Endpoint
- Added `/api/auth/sms-opt-out-verify` endpoint
- Sends TCPA-compliant verification message when SMS reset links are clicked
- Message format: `{CustomerName}, you clicked a password reset link sent via SMS. To stop SMS notifications, reply STOP. For help, reply HELP.`

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Reset password page automatically detects SMS-sourced links
- Sends verification request to backend when `sms=true` parameter is present
- User experience remains seamless - verification happens automatically
