# Production Deployment Environment Setup

## Required Environment Variables

Your password reset system overhaul is complete and ready for production. The application is correctly refusing to start because these critical environment variables need to be configured:

### New Required Variables (Add to Replit Secrets)

1. **PUBLIC_BASE_URL**
   ```
   PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://shopgokul.com
   ```
   - This ensures password reset links point to your production domain
   - Critical for proper email link generation

2. **DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL**
   ```
   DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=info@shopgokul.com
   ```
   - Professional sender address for password reset emails
   - Should match your domain for deliverability

3. **DEFAULT_FROM_NAME**
   ```
   DEFAULT_FROM_NAME=Gokul Wholesale
   ```
   - Brand name shown as email sender
   - Creates professional appearance

4. **TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER**
   ```
   TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+1234567890
   ```
   - Your Twilio phone number for SMS password resets
   - Format: +1 followed by 10-digit number

### Existing Variables (Should Already Be Set)
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID  
- TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
- DATABASE_URL
