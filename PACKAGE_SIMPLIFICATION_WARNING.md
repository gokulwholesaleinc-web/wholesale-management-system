# ⚠️ Package.json Simplification Warning

## Current Status
The current `package.json` contains 100+ dependencies that support:
- React frontend with shadcn/ui components
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Stripe payment processing
- SendGrid email integration
- Twilio SMS services
- OpenAI integration
- Advanced UI components
- Authentication system
- File upload/processing

## Proposed Simplified Package.json
The suggested simplified version only includes:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.19.2", 
    "express-async-errors": "^3.1.1",
    "zod": "^3.23.8"
  }
}
```

## Impact of Simplification
**This will BREAK the current application** because it removes:
- All React frontend dependencies
- Database ORM (Drizzle)
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Email/SMS services
- AI integration
- UI component library
- Authentication dependencies

## Recommendation
1. **Keep current package.json** - The application is fully functional
2. **Add CI/CD and dev container** - These are good additions
3. **Simplify .gitignore and .env.example** - Already implemented

## Alternative: Create Minimal Template
If you want a simplified version for new projects, I can create a separate minimal template while preserving the current working application.
