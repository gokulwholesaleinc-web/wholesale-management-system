# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icons for the PWA manifest:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixel icon for mobile devices
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixel icon for high-resolution displays

For now, the system will work without these icons, but they should be added for a complete PWA experience.

The icons should be:
- Square format
- Simple design representing the POS system
- Brand-consistent with Gokul Wholesale branding
- High contrast for visibility on various backgrounds
