 * ROUTING ARCHITECTURE CONSOLIDATION
 * 
 * DECISION: Use server/routes.ts as SINGLE source of truth
 * REASON: Eliminates duplicate endpoint conflicts
 * 
 * The modular approach was causing endpoint duplicates because:
 * 1. routes.ts defined all endpoints (2000+ lines)
 * 2. Modular files redefined same endpoints
 * 3. Multiple router.use() calls created conflicts
