## Current Twilio Error 30909 Fix

Based on the Twilio CTA verification failure, implementing comprehensive SMS compliance fixes:

### 1. SMS Message Template Compliance Updates

**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Brand name inclusion: "Gokul Wholesale" in all messages
- ✅ STOP instructions for promotional messages  
- ✅ Message length optimization (160 char limit)
- ✅ Transactional vs promotional message distinction

**Message Types Updated:**
1. **Order Confirmation**: `Gokul Wholesale: Thank you [Name]! Order #[ID] confirmed. Total: $[Amount]`
2. **Order Ready**: `Gokul Wholesale: [Name], Order #[ID] is ready for pickup/delivery`
3. **Delivery Update**: `Gokul Wholesale: Delivery update for [Name]. Order #[ID] status: [Status]`
4. **Promotional**: `Gokul Wholesale: Special offer for [Name]! [Offer] Reply STOP to opt out.`
5. **Staff Alert**: `Gokul Wholesale: New order #[ID] from [Name]. $[Amount]. Check app.`

### 2. Account Registration Form Compliance

**Current Issue**: SMS consent checkbox lacks required Twilio CTA verification elements

**Required Updates:**
```html
<input type="checkbox" id="sms-consent" name="sms-consent" unchecked>
<label for="sms-consent">
  I agree to receive SMS text messages from Gokul Wholesale for order notifications 
  and account updates. Message frequency varies, up to 10 messages per week during 
  peak periods. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out or HELP 
  for help. View our Privacy Policy at https://shopgokul.com/privacy-policy
</label>
```

**Compliance Elements Required:**
- ✅ Checkbox unchecked by default
- ✅ Brand disclosure: "from Gokul Wholesale"
- ✅ Message frequency: "up to 10 messages per week during peak periods"
- ✅ Pricing disclosure: "Message and data rates may apply"
- ✅ Opt-out instructions: "Reply STOP to opt out"
- ✅ Help instructions: "or HELP for help"

### 3. Privacy Policy Updates

**Required SMS-Specific Clauses:**
- "No mobile information will be shared with third parties for marketing purposes"
- Specific SMS data usage explanation
- Contact information for customer care
