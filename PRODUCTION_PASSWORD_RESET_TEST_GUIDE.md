**Test now at https://shopgokul.com with username `harsh476`**

If you still don't receive an email, the issue may be:
1. User doesn't exist in production database
2. Environment variables not set in deployment
3. SendGrid delivery issue (check your spam folder)

## Production Environment Requirements
Ensure these are set in Replit Deployment Secrets:
- `APP_URL=https://shopgokul.com`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` (working)
- `DATABASE_URL` (connected)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
