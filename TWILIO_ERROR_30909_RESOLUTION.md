# Twilio Error 30909 Resolution Guide

## Error Details
**Error Code:** 30909  
**Issue:** Campaign vetting rejection - CTA Verification Issue  
**Root Cause:** Unverifiable Call to Action (opt-in mechanism) compliance failure

## Problem Analysis
The Twilio A2P 10DLC campaign was rejected because the review team couldn't verify how customers consent to receive SMS messages. This is a common compliance issue in 2025 due to stricter verification requirements.

## Required Compliance Elements

### 1. **Brand Information** ✅
- Company: Gokul Wholesale
- Registered brand matches messaging brand

### 2. **Message Frequency Disclosure** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX**

**Required:** Clear frequency statements like "Up to 10 messages per week"

### 3. **Pricing Disclosure** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX**  
**Current:** Generic mention  
**Required:** Exact phrase "Message and data rates may apply"

### 4. **Privacy Policy** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX**
**Current:** Basic privacy statement  
**Required:**

## Implementation Fixes Required

<label for="sms-consent">
  I agree to receive SMS text messages from Gokul Wholesale for order notifications 
  and account updates. Message frequency varies, up to 10 messages per week during 
  peak periods. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out or HELP 
  for help. View our Privacy Policy at https://shopgokul.com/privacy-policy
