# CSP + SSE Activity Log Fixes Implementation Complete

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** August 20, 2025  
**Scope:** Complete implementation of CSP and SSE fixes from the comprehensive fix pack

## Summary of Changes Implemented

### ✅ 1. CSP Nonce Middleware (server/routes.ts)
- Added crypto import for nonce generation  
- Implemented CSP middleware with development/production awareness
- **Development mode:** Allows 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline' for Vite HMR
- **Production mode:** Uses strict nonce-based policy
- Added WebSocket support (ws://) for development HMR
- Proper Stripe domain allowlisting maintained

### ✅ 2. SSE Stream Hardening (server/routes/activity-routes.ts)
- Enhanced SSE headers with anti-proxy buffering: `X-Accel-Buffering: no`
- Added `no-transform` to Cache-Control for proxy compatibility
- Maintained existing authentication flow with query token support

### ✅ 3. Activity Router Aliasing (server/routes.ts)
- Added dual route mounting:
  - `/activity` (primary path)
  - `/api/activity` (alias for backward compatibility)
- Both paths support full SSE streaming functionality

### ✅ 4. Client EventSource Enhancement (client/src/pages/AdminActivityLog.tsx)
- Implemented robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Proper stream cleanup and connection management
- Removed duplicate event handlers that were causing conflicts
- Enhanced error logging for debugging SSE connection issues
- Uses `/activity/stream` path for cleaner routing

## Technical Details

### CSP Policy Configuration
```javascript
// Development: Allows Vite HMR and development tools
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' https://js.stripe.com

// Production: Strict nonce-based policy
script-src 'self' 'nonce-<random>' https://js.stripe.com
```

### SSE Headers Applied
```javascript
Content-Type: text/event-stream
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform
Connection: keep-alive
X-Accel-Buffering: no  // Prevents proxy buffering
```

### Authentication Flow
- EventSource uses query parameter token (header limitations)
- Server sets authorization header internally for middleware compatibility
- Robust error handling with proper 401 responses

## Verification Checklist

### ✅ CSP Fixes
- [x] Application loads without blank screen
- [x] No CSP violations in browser console (except extensions)
- [x] Vite HMR works in development mode
- [x] React components render properly

### ✅ SSE Functionality  
- [x] Activity stream connects successfully
- [x] Real-time events stream properly
- [x] Reconnection logic works on connection loss
- [x] Authentication via query token functions

### ✅ System Integration
- [x] Both `/activity/stream` and `/api/activity/stream` work
- [x] Admin Activity Log page displays and updates
- [x] No duplicate event handlers or memory leaks
- [x] Proper stream cleanup on component unmount

## Known Status
- **CSP violations eliminated** for application code
- **SSE authentication working** with query token method
- **Activity log streaming** functional with real-time updates
- **Development environment** fully operational with HMR

## Next Steps Available
The system is now ready for:
1. **POS PWA Staged Rollout** - Infrastructure prepared at `/instore-next/`
2. **Production CSP Hardening** - Nonce-based policy for production deployment
3. **Further SSE Optimizations** - Performance tuning if needed

## Production Deployment Notes
- Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set for strict CSP policy
- Verify WebSocket connectivity for SSE in production environment
- Test activity log functionality end-to-end in production
