# Production Password Reset Debug Report

## Current Status: Frontend Working, Backend Issues

### What's Working:
✅ **Frontend UI**: Password reset dialog displays correctly
✅ **API Response**: Returns success message (security-compliant)
✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive debugging to both services

### The Issue:
The user `harsh476` with email `Harsh@gokulwholesaleinc.com` exists in production but password reset emails/SMS are not being received.

## Investigation Results:

### 1. Frontend Confirmation:
- Password reset dialog shows "Reset Link Sent"
- User interface is working correctly
- Form submission succeeds

### 2. API Testing Results:
**Tested Identifiers:**
- `harsh476` → Success response (but no delivery)
- `Harsh@gokulwholesaleinc.com` → Success response (but no delivery) 
- `harsh@gokulwholesaleinc.com` → Success response (but no delivery)

### 3. Likely Root Causes:

#### Option A: Database Environment Separation
- Production database is separate from development
- Enhanced logging only visible in development environment
- Production logs aren't accessible via development console

#### Option B: Email Service Configuration Issue
- SendGrid API key might be different in production
- Email sending failing silently in production
- Need to check production environment variables

#### Option C: Case Sensitivity Issue
- Email stored as `Harsh@gokulwholesaleinc.com` (capital H)
- Database lookup might be case-sensitive
- User lookup failing due to case mismatch

## Debugging Steps Completed:

1. ✅ Enhanced logging added to password reset service
2. ✅ Enhanced logging added to email service  
3. ✅ Enhanced logging added to storage layer
4. ✅ Fixed `getUserByEmail` method (was using wrong database reference)
5. ✅ Added comprehensive tracking prevention for SendGrid
6. ✅ Testing with exact email variations

## Next Actions Needed:

### Option 1: Check Production Environment Variables
Verify in Replit Deployment Secrets:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` exists and is correct
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` exist
- `DATABASE_URL` points to production database

### Option 2: Test with Known Working Email
Try password reset with a different email that definitely exists in production

### Option 3: Check Production Database Direct
Query production database directly to verify:
- User `harsh476` exists
- Email is exactly `Harsh@gokulwholesaleinc.com`
- Phone number is properly formatted

### Option 4: Enable Production Logging
Check if Replit Deployment logs show the enhanced debugging output

## Recommended Immediate Test:
1. Try password reset with a different known production user
2. Check Replit Deployment logs for the enhanced debug output
3. Verify production environment variables are configured

The system architecture is correct - this is likely an environment configuration or data format issue.
